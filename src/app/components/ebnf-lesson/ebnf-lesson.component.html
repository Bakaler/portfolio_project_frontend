  <h2 class="section-title"><u>EBNF Parsing Calculator</u></h2>

  <p><strong>EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form)</strong> is a notation used to formally describe the structure of 
  grammar wether that be programming languages, math, or English.</p>

  <p><strong>At</strong> its core, EBNF defines what counts as a "valid sentence" in a given language. 
    It breaks down complex expressions into nested rules. </p>

  <h3>Real-World EBNF in Action</h3>
  <p><strong>Natural Language Example:</strong><br>
  Consider the famous phrase: <br>
  <em><strong>"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo."</strong></em><br>
  It’s a grammatically correct English sentence no matter how non-sensical it may sound. 
  <br>To understand how this works, we can look at a rough diagram of English grammar:</p>      
    <pre><code>
        sentence    = noun_phrase , verb_phrase ;
        noun_phrase = [ determiner ] , {{ "{" }} adjective {{ "}" }} , noun , [ r_c ] ;
        verb_phrase = verb , [ noun_phrase ] ;
        r_c         = r_p , verb_phrase ;
        determiner  = "the" | "a" | "an" | "this" | "that" ;
        adjective   = "Buffalo" | ... ; {{"<"}}--- (1) Buffalo (3) Buffalo (7) Buffalo
        noun        = "buffalo" | ... ; {{"<"}}--- (2) buffalo (4) buffalo (8) buffalo 
        verb        = "buffalo" | ... ; {{"<"}}--- (5) buffalo (6) buffalo
        r_p         = "who" | "that" | "which" ;
  </code></pre>
  <p><strong>With that, we can break down the sentence:</strong><br>
  <pre><code>   
                              sentence
                            |         ||
                  noun_phrase         verb_phrase 
                  ||        |         ||       |
            noun_phrase    r_c        verb   noun_phrase
            ||    ||      |   |       ||       |       |
           adj   noun   adj   noun    ||      adj     noun
           ||     ||     |     |      ||       |       |
      Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo
  </code></pre>

  <h2><u>EBNF in My Calculator</u></h2>
  <p>My calculator uses an EBNF-style grammar to evaluate expressions such as:</p>

  <pre><code>    (2 + 3) * 4 ** 2 % 5
    ((0.12**log(5))) % abs((2+1)/sqrt(2))
    ((((((((((0))))))))))
    1 + 1</code></pre>

  <p><strong>These equations are determined by the following grammar:</strong></p>
  <pre><code>         _exp:=
            =
            exp '+' term
            exp '-' term
            term
        _term ::=
            term '*' factor
            term '/' factor
            term '//' factor
            term '%' factor
            factor
        _factor ::=
            '(' exp ')'
            power
        _power ::=
            digit '**' factor
            function
        _function ::=
            [digit | function ] [abs | sqrt | 1/x | n! | 10^y | x^y | log | neg]
            digit
        _digit :: =
            int '.' int
            int
        _int ::=
            int int
            [0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 9]</code></pre>

  <h3>And it understands in real time...</h3>
  <p>The calculator uses EBNF not only to verify the structure of an equation, 
    but also to evaluate user input in real time, parsing even incomplete expressions to check if they follow the expected pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dont believe me? Try entering something like
  </p>
  <pre><code>  1 ++ 0
  ) 2 (
  1.1.1.1.1
  9 ** ** 2log() abc</code></pre>

  <p>
    This live parsing, combined with evaluation parsing, gives the calculator a robust 
    and user-friendly way to guide input and ensure correctness as users type.
  </p>
